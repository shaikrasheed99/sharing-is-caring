# Sharing-is-caring
* This is simple scenario to understand how Mockito frameworks actually works.
* The scenario is, there is a good friend, who have a habit of sharing chocolates, when he has more than two.
* To share his chocolates along with his friends, he uses fully tested sharing service.
* To check whether that service is properly used or not, we will mock the service.
* Mockito will simply create a mock of the service and let us know whether that mocked service is used or not.
